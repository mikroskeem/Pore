# Pore

My try to implement Bukkit API on top of a Sponge API based server.

## Questions?

~~Have an issue or a question about Pore? No problem! Feel free to...~~ No. I don't give any support for this, don't get
your hopes high that this will ever be something more than a toy.

I am just bored and this is the result of boredom.

## Progress
